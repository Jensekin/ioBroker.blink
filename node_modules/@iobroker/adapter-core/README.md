# Adapter-Core
Core module to be used in ioBroker adapters. Acts as the bridge to js-controller.

This replaces the `utils.js` included in the ioBroker template adapter.

## Usage
1. Add this as a dependency: `npm i @iobroker/adapter-core`
2. Replace  
   ```js
   const utils = require(__dirname + '/lib/utils');
   ```
   with
   ```js
   const utils = require('@iobroker/adapter-core');
   ```
3. Create an adapter instance as usual:  
   ```js
   const adapter = utils.adapter( /* options */ );
   ```

## Tips while working on this module
* ```npm run build``` creates a clean rebuild of the module. This is done automatically before every build
* ```npm run lint``` checks for linting errors
* ```npm run watch``` creates an initial build and then incrementally compiles the changes while working.

## Errors in the definitions?
If you find errors in the definitions, e.g. function calls that should be allowed but aren't, please open an issue here or over at https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped and make sure to mention @AlCalzone.
